# FFMPEG PHP extension

This project was originally released on sourceforge.net. This distribution
includes patches by TownNews, tony2001 and Jan-E throughout the years
to keep the extension operational.

It previously only worked with FFMPEG 1.2.12 or older but has been modified
so that it compiles now against newer versions. This extension has been
tested (on Windows) with FFmpeg 3.2.18 against:

* PHP 7.0.33 up until PHP 7.4.30
* PHP 8.0.20 and PHP 8.1.7

There is a separate branch for PHP 5.3 up until PHP 5.6, tested against
all Windows x86 and x64 versions (even PHP 5.3 x64).
